The condensation-system material is placed in a sedimentation tank which is then housed in a supercentrifuge. The supercentrifuge in its rotor is rotation driven by an ultra-high speed rotation power source, and an acceleration field of energy of 100000 G to 1500000 G, i.e., about 100 to 800 m/s in terms of peripheral velocity, is applied to the above condensed (liquid or/and solid) material under such a temperature that is specified by an isotope material to be enriched. In this case, a difference in centrifugal force applied is provided between the isotopes in the condensed (liquid or/and solid) material comprising the at least two isotopes. By virtue of sedimentation by taking advantage of this difference, isotope atoms within the condensed material interact, and, consequently, separation and enrichment of the isotopes can be realized in a higher efficiency than the case where gas is used, by conducting the separation and enrichment of the isotopes within the liquid material, using an effective material, and using a multistaged rotor system."

Such delay circuitry will inherently have a delay which is a function of temperature. In accordance with embodiments of the invention, such temperature-dependent delays are compensated for by adjusting the power supply voltage of the VDL, delay element, or subcircuit. Specifically, a temperature sensing stage is used to sense the temperature of the integrated circuit, and hence the VDL, delay element, or subcircuit. Information concerning the sensed temperature is sent to a regulator which derives the local power supply voltage from the master power supply voltage, Vcc, of the integrated circuit. If the temperature sensed is relatively high, which otherwise would increase the delay though the VDL, delay element, or subcircuit, the regulator increases the local power supply voltage, thus decreasing the delay and offsetting the increase in delay due to temperature. Through this scheme, and assuming the temperature sensing stage is properly tuned, temperature-dependent delays can be reduced to approximately zero."

8139005,"The present invention is in the field of Content protection, most particularly in cinema venues where camcorder acquisition followed by immediate illegal distribution creates important revenue losses for content owners. It is known that anti-camcorder systems using a color modulation can be circumvented by using low shutter speed in the camcorder. Today, the shutter speed is determined automatically by the camcorder as a function of the filmed video source. In automatic configurations, shutter speed self-adapts to either motion, or flicker detection, both of which taking into account brightness variations only. The proposed invention proposes a dual color/brightness modulation to defeat automatic shutter speed adjustment. For example, a color modulation at 50/60 Hz is carried out and a brightness modulation at a higher frequency 100/120 Hz is added to force the camcorder to work at a high shutter speed."

8139749,This disclosure describes techniques of automatically identifying a direction of a speech source relative to an array of directional microphones using audio streams from some or all of the directional microphones. Whether the direction of the speech source is identified using audio streams from some of the directional microphones or from all of the directional microphones depends on whether using audio streams from a subgroup of the directional microphones or using audio streams from all of the directional microphones is more likely to correctly identify the direction of the speech source. Switching between using audio streams from some of the directional microphones and using audio streams from all of the directional microphones may occur automatically to best identify the direction of the speech source.

8139766,"Regional arterial spin labeling (regASL) speeds up acquisition without sacrificing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the resulting perfusion images by using the same control image (i.e. acquired without labeling of blood in a vessel) for two or more vascular territory measurements. This regional ASL is accomplished by creating prepared spin magnetization (e.g. inverted or saturated) in a specific blood vessel, instead of preparing spin magnetization in all feeding blood vessels. As in conventional ASL, two data sets are typically acquired in a downstream position: one with (label image) and one without preparation (control image) in one particular vessel. When regASL is extended to repetitive time series of ASL images to identify perfusion changes for functional MRI (fMRI), the speed of the time series of ASL also is increased because only a single C data set can be used redundantly for all time points of ASL measurement, to reduce the amount of data acquired by nearly one half, with no change in the signal to noise ratio in the ASL images. To account for possible movement of the person causing misregistrations in the time series, the C data can be obtained two or more times throughout the time series while still at lower frequency than in prior techniques with alternating L and C data sets."

8140231,"An intrinsic inter-atrial conduction delay is determined by a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator based, at least in part, on far-field atrial events sensed using ventricular pacing/sensing leads. An atrioventricular pacing delay is then set based on the inter-atrial conduction delay. By detecting atrial events using ventricular leads, rather than using atrial leads, a more useful measurement of the intrinsic inter-atrial conduction delay can be obtained. In this regard, since atrial electrodes detect atrial activity locally around the electrodes, a near-field atrial event sensed using an atrial electrode might not properly represent the actual timing of the atrial event across both the right and left atria. Far-field atrial events sensed using ventricular leads thus allow for a more useful measurement of inter-atrial conduction delays for use in setting atrioventricular pacing delays. The delivery of individual V-pulses to the heart of the patient may be timed relative to the ends of individual far-field atrial events."

The weaker base(s) are nucleophilic and have the ability to react directly with the CO<sub>2 </sub>in the gas stream while the relatively stronger bases act as non-nucleophilic promoters for the reaction between the CO<sub>2 </sub>and the weaker base. The sorption and desorption temperatures can be varied by selection of the amine/base combination, permitting effective sorption temperatures of 70 to 90° C., favorable to scrubbing flue gas."

8142270,The various embodiments herein provide a method of producing silver nanoparticles using an electromagnetic levitation melting process. The method comprises levitating and melting a silver sample using a suitable levitation coil and stabilizing a droplet of molten silver. The silver droplet is heated and levitated simultaneously by an induction furnace as a generator. Argon gas is used to provide the inert atmosphere and also applied to cool and condense the silver vapor into a silver nano powder to obtain a silver nano particle. The synthesized silver nanoparticles are collected by brushing them off the brass cylinder using inert gas and are kept in pure Hexane. The size of the nanoparticles is controlled by rate of cooling and heating temperature. The electromagnetic levitation melting method is applied to provide the high purity of silver nano particles with no vacuum equipments.
